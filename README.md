# Positioning and Floating Elements
This project consisted of making a clone of a New York Times article page.The New York Times has been a leader in experimenting with the inclusion of multimedia content in traditional stories. Which creates all kinds of interesting position questions.
Here's the original page http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0

By this point, we needed to be familiar with the concepts of:

Embedding images and videos
Working with forms (buttons in this case)
Floats and positioning
The box model

Here are some of the things we did

Thought about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.
Layed out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned.
Set up the top navigation bar, body and the footer.
Filled in and positioned the additional sections
Embeded a YouTube video of choice into the page.
