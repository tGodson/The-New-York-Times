# Embedding Images and Video
This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of youtube
The goal here was to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up.
That meant two things ‚Äì embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and shows little thumbnail images along the right side.

Here are some of the things i did
Created empty semantic HTML elements to enclose those sections.
Used basic CSS to size and position the elements appropriately on the page. 
Embeded a YouTube video of choice into the page.
Next, i built the sidebar section where previews of suggested videos showed up. 

Built With
Major frameworks
HTML and CSS
